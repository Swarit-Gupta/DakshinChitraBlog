            <h2>The Journey Begins</h2>
            <p>We started our journey early in the morning in our college bus, filled with excitement and laughter. After a pleasant drive, we reached <strong>Dakshin Chitra</strong>, a well-known heritage center that represents the art, architecture, and culture of South India.</p>
            <p>Dakshin Chitra is a living museum that showcases the art, architecture, lifestyle, crafts, and performing arts of South India. It presents the heritage of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Andhra Pradesh through authentic regional architecture and cultural displays.</p>

            <p>Our first stop was the craft bazaar, which exhibits and sells artefacts and souvenirs made by traditional craftsmen. It was full of colourful stalls displaying handicrafts, handmade bags and mats, paintings, and handmade jewellery. It was amazing to see how much patience and creativity went into each product. The traditional arts and design looked mesmerizing.</p>

            <h2>Exploring Heritage Houses</h2>
            <img src="images/heritage_house.jpg" alt="Traditional House at Dakshin Chitra" class="section-img">
            <p>Next, we went through different types of traditional houses from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. Each house was beautifully built, giving us a glimpse into how people lived centuries ago. As we walked from one house to another, it felt like we were travelling through time, each doorway opening into a different part of South India's story.</p>
            <p>The houses included models showing daily life activities, providing great insight into the days of yore. We were amazed by how thoughtfully each house was constructed, considering climate, materials, and lifestyle. The wooden doors, antique utensils, and handwoven mats made the experience even more real, as if families were about to return any second.</p>

            <h2>Gratitude</h2>
            <p>At last, I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to our professor for arranging this wonderful trip and giving us such a memorable experience outside the classroom. It was truly a day filled with joy, learning, and unforgettable memories that we will cherish for a long time. We truly appreciate her patience, guidance, and the care she showed for us throughout the trip.</p>
